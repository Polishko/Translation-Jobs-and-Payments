# Translation-Jobs-and-Payments
This database will be used to manage my translation jobs and their purchase orders and payments.

I will be using this database to track open and closed projects, payment orders, payment due dates and statuses.

Current status: Information for each table, all functions, procedures and triggers and the database design.

Short-term goals: Adding views/joined tables to handle most common tasks.

Long-term goals: 
- Adding information on project managers and setting an email trigger to remind them about any missing, overdue purchase orders.
- Creating a user friendly interface where translators can easily manage their own projects by simply entering necessary information to provided fields.
