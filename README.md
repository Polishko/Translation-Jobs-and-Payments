# Translation-Jobs-and-Payments
a database used to manage my translation jobs and their payments

I will be using this database to track open and closed projects, payment orders, payment due dates and statuses.

Current status: the necessary functions, procedures and triggers were added. The ERD for database was updated with current version.
